The following examples are similar
to the `Nengo core examples <https://www.nengo.ai/nengo/examples.html>`_,
but run using Nengo Loihi.
We compare performance with Nengo core where appropriate.

=========

These are models that have been developed using Nengo Loihi.
They are not actively maintained by the Nengo Loihi team,
and they are not intended as teaching examples.
But if you'd like to see Nengo Loihi
used in real-world projects, check them out.
